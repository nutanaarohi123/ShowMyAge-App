# ShowMyAge-App
MVVM based android project via view binding and view model

**Show My Age** :child: Android project 

_Language Used_
* Kotlin

_Mini project for beginner trying to implement MVVM and viewbinding_

Usuages :
* user need to input the year of birth
* accordingly, your age is displayed on clicking show My Age button 

Layout used :
* Constraint Layout
* ScrollView (so user if rotate screen , can scroll freely ,  resulting flexible layout)

*Why MVVM*

If the user rotates the activity is stopped and started again.
so the data is lost and user need to click button again.thus to save livedata , I have used viewModel .

app layout 
 * Home Layout
